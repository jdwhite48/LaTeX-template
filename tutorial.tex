\maketitle

By default, the first line is indented (i.e. \textbackslash{parindent} is enabled); But, if parskip default in \href{run:./imports.tex}{imports.tex} is not overriden, this will not be indented.
This is on the same paragraph as the previous line. Newlines (\textbackslash \textbackslash) are necessary for regular lines.\\
The line thereafter is non-indented regardless, however.\\
This is a URL: \url{https://www.google.com}, and this is \href{https://www.google.com}{URL to Google}.\\
This is non-indented text on the next line.\\
\indent This is a manually-indented line.
\par\indent This is a manually-indented paragraph on its own line, with spacing on both ends if importing parskip.
\par\noindent This is a manually non-indented paragraph.
\par This paragraph has more space after it (newlines are unnecessary). \\
\par This is another paragraph.
This text line is part of the previous paragraph.\\
Put a \textbackslash\textbackslash\xspace or another \textbackslash{par} after a line in a multi-line paragraph to end the paragraph. 
\par\noindent However, you also need newlines before new environments even if it's a paragraph...\\

    This is a problem. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

(An aside comment between problem and solution.)

    %%% Most of the math macros that can conceivably be used standalone in text can also be written without being enclosed in math environment delimiters as well.
    \par There are \approxtilde 7,000,000 humans in the world today. This statement is true (\true). (or maybe \false if you want to be precise...). 
    \par \abs{-1} is 1 and \nthroot{3}{27} is 3. \Pr{0=1} is 0. The set \set{1} contains only 1, and \cset{x}{x \in A} has a condition associated with it. This \bigcdot is a bullet. \complement{S} is the collection of elements in the "universe" set $U$ that aren't also in $S \subseteq U$.

    \par The world holds \WLOG to everything. \Wrt the universe, this should make sense. \Wlog, everything is \str{null} \wrt our perception.
    %%% This is all to show how \yields works
    \par We can define a Turing Machine configuration using strings $u,v \in \Sigma^*$, symbol $a \in \Sigma$, and state $q \in Q$ as $uqav$, where the head of the Turing Machine resides at the symbol $a$ in the input tape $uav$. Furthermore, we say that a configuration yields another, written e.g. $uqav \yields ubrv$, if there exists a transition function $\delta(q, a) = (r, b, R)$ that takes the Turing Machine from one configuration to the other. In this example, the Turing Machine reads $a$, writes $b$, transitions from state $q$ to $r$, and moves the head right by one position to the first symbol in $v$. This \blanksymbol is a blank symbol used in Turing Machine tapes but not in the alphabet.
    \par This is an empty string: \emptystring, and this is a trivial grammar: $S \derives \emptysymbol$. This is a string derivation using a grammar: $aS \derives abS \derives abc \equiv aS \derivesto abc$.
    \par This is a directed path from a to b: $a \pathto b$ and this is an undirected path: $a \undirpath b$.
