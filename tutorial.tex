\maketitle

By default, the first line is indented (i.e. \textbackslash{parindent} is enabled); But, if parskip default in \href{run:./imports.tex}{imports.tex} is not overriden, this will not be indented.
This is on the same paragraph as the previous line. Newlines (\textbackslash \textbackslash) are necessary for regular lines.\\
The line thereafter is non-indented regardless, however.\\
This is a URL: \url{https://www.google.com}, and this is \href{https://www.google.com}{URL to Google}.\\
This is non-indented text on the next line.\\
\indent This is a manually-indented line.
\par This is an indented paragraph on its own line, with spacing on both ends due to parskip
\par\noindent This is a manually non-indented paragraph.
\par This paragraph has more space after it (newlines are unnecessary). \\
\par This is another paragraph.
This text line is part of the previous paragraph.\\
Put a \textbackslash\textbackslash or another \textbackslash{par} after a line in a multi-line paragraph to end the paragraph. 
\par\noindent However, you also need newlines before new environments even if it's a paragraph...\\

\begin{problem} 
    This is a problem. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. There is also some math in here: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

(An aside comment between problem and solution.)
\begin{solution}
    (solution environment starts with \textbackslash{par} to create indentation, and also ends page once done so each problem is on a separate line)
